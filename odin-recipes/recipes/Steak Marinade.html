    <h1>Description </h1>
        <p>Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. </p>
        <p> Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and, with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul><li> Oil: This top-rated steak marinade recipe starts with olive oil, which keeps the meat nice and moist.</li>
    <li>Â· Sauces: You'll need Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Hot sauce is optional, but it's a great addition for people who appreciate a little heat.</li>
    <li>Lemon juice: The acidity from the lemon juice cuts through the other flavors, adding welcome brightness. The acid also helps tenderize the meat even further.</li>
    <li>Spices and seasonings: This flavorful marinade is seasoned with dried basil, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, white pepper, and minced garlic. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
